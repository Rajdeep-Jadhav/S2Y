## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Spotify Developer Account**: Required for obtaining `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `redirect_uri`. Sign up [here](https://developer.spotify.com/) and create a new app to get the credentials.
- **YouTube Music API**: This app uses the `ytmusicapi` library for retrieving YouTube Music data.
- **Spotipy**: The app interacts with the Spotify API using the `Spotipy` library.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/S2Y.git

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd S2Y

3. **Install the Required Python Libraries:**
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
The requirements.txt file should include libraries such as spotipy, ytmusicapi, and streamlit.

## Spotify API Setup
To use this app, you need to create Spotify API credentials and configure a redirect URI.

### Steps to Create Spotify API Credentials
1. **Create a Spotify Developer Account:**
   - Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and log in with your Spotify account. If you donâ€™t have an account, create one.

2. **Create a New App:**
   - In the Dashboard, click on **Create an App**.
   - Provide an app name and description. For example:
     - **App Name:** Spotify to YouTube Music Recommender
     - **App Description:** An app that recommends YouTube Music songs based on a Spotify playlist.
   - Click **Create**.

3. **Get API Credentials:**
   - After creating the app, you'll see your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** on the app dashboard. These are necessary for the code to work.

4. **Set the Redirect URI:**
   - In your app settings, scroll down to the **Redirect URIs** section.
   - Add a URI that Spotify will use to redirect after authentication. For local development, you can use:
     ```
     http://localhost:8501/callback
     ```
## First-Time Setup with Spotify Authentication
If this is your first time running the app, follow these additional steps to authenticate with Spotify:

1. **Spotify Authentication:**
   - When you run the app for the first time, Spotify will prompt you to authenticate your app.
   - A new browser tab will open, where you must log in to Spotify and grant the necessary permissions.
   - After logging in and approving access, Spotify will redirect you to a page with a URL. This may show an error, which is expected.

2. **Provide the Redirect URL:**
   - Copy the URL from the browser's address bar after the redirection (even if it shows an error).
   - Paste it back into the terminal where Streamlit is running.
